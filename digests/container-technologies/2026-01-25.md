## Executive Summary

BuildKit and Moby saw significant updates, including the release of BuildKit v0.27.0 with signed release images and an updated Dockerfile frontend, and Moby v29.2.0-rc.2 which includes NRI information in the `/info` endpoint. Skopeo addressed CVE-2025-65637 and CVE-2024-3727, and Buildah bumped its runc version to address CVE-2025-52881, highlighting a focus on security. Podman Desktop released versions 1.25.0 and 1.25.1 with bug fixes and new features such as extension allowance and session access control.

## Cross-Project Trends

*   Both Buildah and Moby updated their dependencies to address security vulnerabilities in underlying components (runc and containerd respectively). This demonstrates a continued industry-wide effort to rapidly respond to disclosed issues and highlights the shared dependency chain.

## Project Updates

### Docker / Moby

*   **Moby v29.2.0-rc.2 Released:** This release candidate includes the Node Resource Interface (NRI) field in the `/info` endpoint and adds an Identity field to the inspect endpoint to show trusted origin information about images.

## Technical Discussions

*   **Podman `cp` permission issues:** The discussion about `podman cp` and permission issues when accessing files inside a rootless container highlights the complexities of user namespaces and security contexts.
    *   [https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/27950](https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/27950)
*   **Podman + socket activation + openssh:** The experimental demo of Podman with socket activation and OpenSSH could enable interesting use cases around minimal networking container configurations.
    *   [https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/27948](https://github.com/containers/podman/discussions/27948)
*   **Podman IPAM error:** The reported IPAM error after repeated container creation/deletion cycles warrants further investigation into resource management within Podman's networking stack.  The workaround of removing the `ipam.db` file suggests a potential issue with IP address allocation persistence.
