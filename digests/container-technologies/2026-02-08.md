## Executive Summary

Docker Engine 29.2.1 fixes several bugs, including issues with `docker system df`, daemon crashes, and encrypted overlay networks. Buildah 1.43.0 includes fixes related to image tagging and runc version upgrades. The Docker forums show a user struggling with Docker's `watch` feature, and several users are encountering issues with disk usage, DNS resolution and container networking.

## Cross-Project Trends

Both Docker and Podman ecosystems are actively addressing container networking issues. Docker fixed a bug with encrypted overlay networks, while Podman users are discussing how to change directory ownership within containers.

## Critical/Urgent

*   **Docker Engine: Encrypted Overlay Networks Issue (Breaking Change):** Version 29.2.1 fixes an issue where encrypted overlay networks did not pass traffic to containers on older engine versions. A side effect of the fix is that encrypted overlay networks will *no longer* pass traffic on engines v29.2.0 thru v29.0.0, v28.2.2, v25.0.14 or v25.0.13. Users relying on these older engine versions using encrypted overlay networks need to update to the latest patch version. (moby/moby#51951)
