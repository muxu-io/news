## Executive Summary

Podman 5.8.0 was released with features including Quadlet improvements, AppArmor profile configuration, optimized artifact handling, and `podman update --ulimit`.  A BoltDB to SQLite migration is now automatic in Podman, with manual migration available via `podman system migrate --migrate-db` as BoltDB support will be removed in Podman 6.0. Several bugfixes for healthchecks and `podman kube play` were also included.  Skopeo 1.22.0 was released with a set of minor changes.

## Cross-Project Trends

*   Both the Docker forum discussions and Podman release notes highlight the complexity of networking configuration, particularly around IPv6. Both projects continue to refine features in this area.

## Critical/Urgent

*   **Podman 6.0 Breaking Change:** Podman 6.0 will remove BoltDB support. Users must migrate to SQLite. The migration is now automatic, but manual migration using `podman system migrate --migrate-db` is available.
