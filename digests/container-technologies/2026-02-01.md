## Executive Summary
Docker Engine 29.2.0 and API v1.53 were released, featuring NRI support in `docker info` and trusted origin information in image inspect. BuildKit 0.27.1 fixed a potential panic with GitHub Actions cache verification. Podman users reported significant slowdowns building DB2 databases, and difficulty accessing registries with self-signed certificates when TLS verification is disabled.

## Cross-Project Trends
Both Docker and Podman communities are grappling with networking configuration, particularly around DNS resolution and port forwarding, highlighting the ongoing complexity of container networking.

## Critical/Urgent
None.

## Project Updates

### Docker / Moby

*   **Docker Engine:** Version 29.2.0 released.
    *   Includes NRI section in `docker info` output (docker/cli#6710, moby/moby#51711, moby/moby#51712, moby/moby#51675, moby/moby#51674, moby/moby#51636, moby/moby#51634).
    *   Adds an Identity field to the inspect endpoint showing trusted origin information about the image (moby/moby#51737).
    *   Improves validation of `--detach-keys` command-line options (docker/cli#6742).
    *   Removes restriction on anonymous read-only volumes (moby/moby#51682).
    *   The `--validate` flag on dockerd now verifies system requirements before daemon start (moby/moby#51868).
    *   Handles `--gpus` requests for NVIDIA devices using CDI if possible (moby/moby#50228).
    *   **Rootless:** Considers `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cdi` and `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cdi` when looking for CDI devices (moby/moby#51624).
    *   Updates RootlessKit to v2.3.6 (moby/moby#51757).
    *   Natively supports gRPC on the listening socket (moby/moby#50744).
    *   Removes `%PROGRAMDATA%\Docker\cli-plugins` from the list of paths used for CLI plugins on Windows (docker/cli#6713).
*   **Docker Engine API:** Version v1.53.0 released.
    *   GET `/info` now includes an NRI field (moby/moby#51713).
    *   Adds an Identity field to the inspect endpoint showing trusted origin information about the image (moby/moby#51737).
    *   GET `/events` now also supports `application/jsonl` when negotiating content-type (moby/moby#51668).
    *   Explicitly rejects multiple AuthConfig values being passed (moby/moby#51919).
    *   Fixes some empty fields not being omitted in API responses (moby/moby#51932).
    *   POST `/grpc` and POST `/sessions` are deprecated (moby/moby#51721). **Breaking Change:** These endpoints will be removed in a future release.
*   **Docker Engine Client:** Version v0.2.2 released.
    *   GET `/events` now also supports `application/jsonl` when negotiating content-type (moby/moby#51668).
    *   The `http.Client` value passed to `client.WithHTTPClient()` is now copied rather than mutated in-place (moby/moby#51817).
    *   `client: ContainerListOptions`: deprecate `Since`, `Before`, and `Latest` fields (moby/moby#51908).
*   **BuildKit:** Version v0.27.1 released.
    *   Fixes a potential panic when verifying the signature of GitHub Actions cache (moby/policy-helpers#21).

### Podman Ecosystem

*   **Podman:** Users reported significant slowdowns when building DB2 databases within Podman containers starting with version 5.6 (podman/discussions/27954). *Action Required: Investigate performance regressions in Podman 5.6+.*
*   **Podman:** A discussion highlights the difficulty of accessing registries with self-signed certificates when TLS verification is disabled, as Podman defaults to HTTP (podman/discussions/27992). *Action Required: Evaluate behavior with registries using self-signed certificates.*
*   **Podman:** Rootless build ambient capability warnings create a perverse incentive against rootless usage, suggesting downgrading the warnings to info/debug or providing a configuration option to suppress them (podman/discussions/27967).
*   **Podman:** Discussion proposes adopting Rust for performance, safety, and binary size improvements, gradually introducing it into parts of the codebase (podman/discussions/27959).
*   **Podman:** A user is seeking to assign different DNS domain names for each podman network (podman/discussions/27994).
*   **Podman Desktop:** Version 1.25.1 released with fixes and feature backports (podman-desktop/podman-desktop/releases/tag/v1.25.1).
*   **Podman Desktop:** A user reports that Podman refuses to start in Windows (podman/discussions/27953).

## Technical Discussions

*   **Docker Forums - General:** Several threads discuss container networking issues, including port forwarding, DNS resolution inside containers after host reboot, and managing configuration across development and production environments.
*   **Docker Forums - Engine:** A user is encountering difficulties accessing Docker containers locally while running Wireguard with a killswitch, highlighting the complexity of integrating container networking with VPN configurations.
