## Executive Summary

Fedora is actively working on Rawhide and ELN composes, including package upgrades and removals related to desktop environments and Azure services. A package review is underway for GKlib, a library required by METIS. A Fedora Council meeting is scheduled to discuss the outcomes of the 2026 Strategy Summit.

## Cross-Project Trends

*   **Package Reviews:** Multiple requests for package reviews (GKlib, lesspipe) indicate ongoing efforts to maintain and expand Fedora's software offerings across different projects.
*   **Rust Tooling:** The addition of Rust-related packages (e.g., `rust-ctor`, `rust-dtor`, `rust-nix`) in Rawhide signifies a continued investment in the Rust ecosystem within Fedora.

## Critical/Urgent

*   **MUMPS Segmentation Fault:** The repeated requests for help debugging segmentation faults in recent MUMPS releases (not in Fedora) suggest a potentially critical issue needing investigation, although it doesn't directly impact running Fedora systems.

## Project Updates

### Fedora Atomic

*   **Fedora CoreOS:**  A community meeting is scheduled to discuss "Expanding Ignition with Cloud-Specific Configuration for Azure." This directly addresses provisioning and cloud integration within the FCOS ecosystem.  Rawhide builds have temporarily reverted from Konflux to the standard pipeline due to infrastructure flakiness.
*   **Silverblue/Kinoite:**
    *   Users are reporting issues with video playback in Flatpak versions of Firefox and Chromium.
    *   Discussion revolves around managing limitations of immutable OSes, specifically concerning VPN clients and Zsh customization.

### Talos

*   **Talos v1.12.4 Released:** This release includes:
    *   KubeSpan advertised network filters, allowing exclusion of CIDRs.
    *   IPv6 GRE support.
    *   Linux kernel update to 6.18.9.

## Technical Discussions

*   **Packaging lesspipe:** Andreas Haupt is seeking advice on packaging lesspipe for Fedora/EPEL due to conflicts with the built-in less preprocessor.  This highlights challenges in packaging software that overlaps with existing tools.
*   **Protobuf & gRPC as static-only:** A discussion thread explores the complexities and potential bugs introduced when packaging Protobuf and gRPC as shared libraries. It raises questions about documenting upstream limitations and bundling software.
*    **Correct way to inject ssh host keys with etc transient activated:** How best to configure ssh host keys with bootc, etc transient configuration.
