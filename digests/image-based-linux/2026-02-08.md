## Executive Summary

This week's updates highlight Fedora's branching of F44, continued focus on Rust security updates, and the release of Talos v1.12.3 with dm-integrity and v1.13.0-alpha.1 introducing EnvironmentConfig and ExternalVolumeConfig.  Fedora also discusses OpenSSL rebasing and its implications on security and developer experience. Kairos pushed out multiple releases focusing on ARM artifact builds.

## Cross-Project Trends

*   **Rust Security:** The coordinated mini-mass rebuild in Fedora to address multiple Rust crate CVEs demonstrates a proactive, cross-package approach to security maintenance.

## Critical/Urgent

*   **Fedora OpenSSL Rebasing Discussion:** The discussion about OpenSSL versions in Fedora highlights a potential conflict between maintaining stable releases (backporting fixes) and providing developers with access to newer feature releases. This impacts the image building as it can affect the included packages, and may impact security posture.

## Project Updates

### Fedora Atomic

*   **Fedora 44 Branching:** Fedora 44 branched from Rawhide. The release engineering process, led by Patrik, was refined. ([https://www.scrye.com/blogs/nirik/posts/2026/02/07/misc-fedora-bits-1st-week-of-feb-2026/](https://www.scrye.com/blogs/nirik/posts/2026/02/07/misc-fedora-bits-1st-week-of-feb-2026/))

*   **Rust Security Mini-Mass Rebuild:** Fedora is conducting a mini-mass rebuild of Rust applications to address security vulnerabilities in the `bytes`, `git2`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `time` crates.  Side tags are used for the rebuilds across Fedora versions. ([https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GM3WF7DD6BPGCJDRS6GPBYOVAUOJM26O/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GM3WF7DD6BPGCJDRS6GPBYOVAUOJM26O/))

### Talos

*   **v1.12.3 Released:** Includes Linux kernel update (6.18.8) with dm-integrity, Raspberry Pi 5 support, and various bug fixes. ([https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/tag/v1.12.3](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/tag/v1.12.3))

*   **v1.13.0-alpha.1 Released:** Introduces EnvironmentConfig for specifying environment variables (replaces `.machine.env`), supports virtiofs-based external volumes (ExternalVolumeConfig). The protobuf format has changed from map<string,string> to map<string,message> for EtcdConfigs, KubeletConfigs, ControllerManagerConfigs, SchedulerConfigs or APIServerConfigs. ([https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/tag/v1.13.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/releases/tag/v1.13.0-alpha.1))

### Kairos

*   **v3.7.0, v3.7.1, v3.7.2 Released:** Several patch releases focused on ARM artifact builds. ([https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/releases))

## Technical Discussions

*   **Fedora OpenSSL rebasing:**  A discussion about whether stable Fedora releases should rebase OpenSSL to newer feature releases (instead of backporting security fixes) due to short lifecycles of non-LTS OpenSSL versions. This highlights a tension between providing developers with the latest features and maintaining a stable base.  The current Fedora policy favors stability, requiring FESCo approval for major updates.
