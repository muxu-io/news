## Executive Summary

This week's focus is on Fedora Rawhide and ELN package updates, with notable activity around ImageMagick and the introduction of `clevis-pin-trustee`.  The Fedora CoreOS community discussed Ignition extensions. There were also discussions on the challenges around Node.js versions and improvements to RPM dependency generation.

## Cross-Project Trends

*   **Package Updates:** Several updates, like ImageMagick, are being pushed to both Fedora Rawhide and ELN, suggesting a synchronized development approach.
*   **Automated testing frustrations**: The Go mass rebuild uncovered challenges in automating test result analysis, which may point to a need for improved tooling across projects that rely on automated builds.

## Critical/Urgent

*   **libarrow SONAME bump:** This requires rebuilds of dependent packages (ceph, gdal, groonga, root, buildbox) and could potentially cause breakage if not handled carefully. Two side tags were created.
*   **gedit API/ABI incompatibility:** An incompatible update to gedit, gedit-plugins, and related libraries has been approved for Fedora 43.

## Project Updates

### Fedora Atomic

*   **Fedora CoreOS:** Discussion on the lifecycle of FCOS releases.
*   **Silverblue/Kinoite:** Users are encountering issues with virt-manager ("No module named 'typing_extensions'") and difficulty installing kernel modules, suggesting ongoing challenges with layering packages and drivers on immutable systems. A user is facing "Could not depsolve transaction" issues when installing packages on CoreOS.
*   **Kinoite:** Another user reports that `menu_auto_hide` is not working.

### bootc / ostree

*   A user had issues getting started with `bootc` on a Hetzner VPS, specifically a failure in the `bootloader-update` unit, and a missing EFI partition. This highlights potential challenges with `bootc` adoption on certain cloud platforms.

### Fedora

*   **Rust crates**: Neerali Shah from Microsoft is working on building dependencies for the Guest Proxy Agent in Fedora.
*   **Node.js version discrepancy:** A mismatch in Node.js versions between `nodejs-devel` and `/usr/bin/node` in rawhide has been reported.
*   **RPM's ELF dependency generator:** Discussion on improving RPM's ELF dependency generator to handle symbol dependencies more accurately.
*   **Slow fedpkg new-sources uploads:** Reports of slow upload speeds continue, despite CPU usage fixes. This may affect developer workflows.
*   **libcamera soname bump:** Requires rebuilds of `pipewire-plugin-libcamera` and `libcamera-apps`.
*   **Go 1.26 Mass Rebuild:** Mass rebuild is commencing.

## Technical Discussions

*   **Improving RPM's ELF dependency generator:** The discussion around improving RPM's ELF dependency generator highlights the complexities of managing shared object dependencies, especially in the context of symbol versions and backward compatibility. This is directly relevant to the stability and update process of image-based systems.
