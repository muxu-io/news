## Executive Summary

The past week saw continued discussion around improving RPM's ELF dependency generator, focusing on versioned symbols and their impact on library dependencies, particularly in the context of Python. The `bootc` project released version 1.12.1, which includes improvements to composefs support and a critical bugfix for installations without separate `/boot` partitions. Fedora CoreOS is exploring expanding Ignition to include cloud-specific configuration for Azure, driven by changes in Azure's provisioning mechanisms.

## Cross-Project Trends

*   **Dependency Management:** Multiple threads discuss improving dependency management within RPM, particularly around shared libraries and symbol versioning. This is relevant across all image-based distributions that rely on RPM for package management.
*   **Ignition Evolution:** Fedora CoreOS's discussion of expanding Ignition for cloud-specific configuration reflects a broader trend of provisioning tools adapting to the evolving cloud landscape. This mirrors efforts in other projects like Kairos, which aims to handle diverse infrastructure.

## Critical/Urgent

*   **bootc v1.12.1 Bugfix:** The bugfix in `bootc` v1.12.1 regarding mount point checks is critical, especially for projects utilizing `bootc-image-builder` or `osbuild` to create images without separate `/boot` partitions. Update is highly recommended.

## Project Updates

### bootc / ostree

*   **bootc 1.12.1 Released:** The release includes:
    *   Shell completion generation command.
    *   Composefs improvements
    *   Fixes for mount point checks, status output corruption, and packing failures.
    *   CI and build system improvements.
    *   URL: [https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/releases/tag/v1.12.1](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/releases/tag/v1.12.1)

### Fedora Atomic

*   **Rawhide Composes:** Regular updates to Fedora Rawhide and ELN composes, including package additions, removals, and upgrades. The ELN compose added a container base image for s390x.

### Fedora CoreOS

*   **Ignition Discussion:** Fedora CoreOS is evaluating expanding Ignition to include cloud-specific configuration for Azure, addressing Azure's shift away from WALinuxAgent and upcoming changes to confidential VM provisioning. A video meeting is scheduled to discuss this further.

## Technical Discussions

*   **Improving RPM's ELF dependency generator:** Ongoing discussions on the Fedora devel mailing list about improving RPM's handling of ELF dependencies, focusing on leveraging versioned symbols. Potential solutions involve changes to RPM itself, adoption of versioned symbols by upstream libraries, and alternative dependency resolution methods.
    *   This directly impacts image-based distributions as it relates to the robustness and compatibility of layered packages.
