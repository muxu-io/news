## Executive Summary

This week focuses on maintenance and dependency updates within the Fedora ecosystem, particularly around toolchain components like `binutils`, `gcc`, `net-snmp`, and `taglib`. The `rpm-ostree` project released v2026.1, including fixes for package layering and improvements to kernel-install integration and a new image composition option to disable initramfs creation. The Fedora CoreOS community discussed cloud-specific configuration for Azure via Ignition.

## Cross-Project Trends

*   **Dependency Updates & Mass Rebuilds:** Multiple projects are impacted by updates to core dependencies like `binutils`, `gcc`, `net-snmp`, and `taglib`, triggering mass rebuilds in Fedora. This highlights the interconnectedness of the distribution and the need for careful coordination when updating fundamental components. The resolution of FTBFS (Fails To Build From Source) issues, especially those related to toolchain updates, is a recurring theme.

## Critical/Urgent

*   **`net-snmp` SONAME bump:** The `net-snmp` SONAME bump in Fedora Rawhide requires rebuilding dependent packages and has already caused build failures. Some packages require fixes beyond a simple rebuild. This is a potential disruption and requires prompt action from maintainers.
*   **`taglib` SONAME bump:** Similar to `net-snmp`, the `taglib` SONAME bump also necessitates rebuilds and compatibility packages.
*   **`binutils` regressions in aarch64:** A regression in `binutils` on aarch64 is causing link failures, impacting the ruby build. This needs investigation and a fix.
*   **Fedora CoreOS SSH Issues:** SSH logins are failing after upgrading Fedora CoreOS to 43.20260105.3.0, requiring investigation to determine the root cause.

## Project Updates

### bootc / ostree

*   **rpm-ostree v2026.1 Release:** Includes `no-initramfs` compose option useful for edge/IoT deployments where a minimal boot environment is desired. Also includes critical bug fixes for kernel-install integration, and package layering. This release merits testing and consideration for projects using rpm-ostree for OS delivery.

### Fedora Atomic

*   **Fedora CoreOS Community Meeting:** Discussed expanding Ignition with cloud-specific configuration for Azure. This aligns with the trend of enhancing provisioning capabilities for cloud environments.
*   **Fedora CoreOS SSH regression:** A regression in Fedora CoreOS 43.20260105.3.0 is preventing SSH logins. Rolling back resolves the issue.

### Talos

*   **Talos v1.12.2 Release:** Minor release with various fixes including platform fixes for oracle and hetzner, OOM controller tuning, vlan support for openstack, and updating to Go 1.25.6

### Fedora

*   **FLTK 1.4 update:** Rawhide is getting an update to FLTK 1.4.4, requiring rebuilds of dependent packages, with some packages being reverted to FLTK 1.3 due to build issues.

## Technical Discussions

*   **Improving RPM's ELF Dependency Generator:** A discussion about improving RPM's ELF dependency generator to handle DSO versions more accurately, aiming to avoid ABI issues. The conversation mentions challenges around upstream versioning practices and the need for overrides.
