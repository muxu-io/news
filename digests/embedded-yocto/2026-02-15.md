## Executive Summary

The Yocto Project 6.0 Milestone 1 has been released. OpenEmbedded Core received updates including a fix for `openat2` issues, and several improvements to the `devtool ide-sdk` for enhanced debugging. NXP's meta-freescale layer sees multiple updates focused on i.MX9 series support and addressing the deprecated `UBOOT_CONFIG` syntax. Security updates have been applied to `avahi` and `freerdp`.

## Critical/Urgent
- **Security**: Multiple CVEs patched in `avahi` (CVE-2025-68468, CVE-2025-68471, CVE-2026-24401) and `freerdp` (CVE-2026-22854, CVE-2026-22855). These should be backported to production BSPs.
- **Breaking Change**: meta-freescale adapted U-Boot configuration for i.MX93/943 to the deprecated `UBOOT_CONFIG` syntax, which requires updating BSPs that use those machines (requires wrynose or later, as the old syntax will be removed after wrynose).

## Yocto Core
- **Fix:** The `pseudo` recipe has been updated to include a fix for `openat2` issues, resolving build failures related to `tar` on systems like alma9. (2c20c05b324e5d6564c8554381019170839509bb)
- **Enhancement:** The `populate_sdk_ext` class now correctly handles `BB_BASHSERBVE_DB_DIR` when creating eSDK local.conf files. (3a8f0075d52cb653118774baa03aa8d5231f943c)
- **Enhancement:** The `devtool ide-sdk` now supports GDB pretty-printing for C++ STL types, improving the debugging experience for C++ applications by displaying STL containers in a more readable format. (a69e2baba81b0cd88d58b164433c72e1156424b1)
- **Enhancement:** The `devtool ide-sdk` now evaluates `DEBUG_PREFIX_MAP` when generating GDB debug-file-directory mappings, which allows for more accurate source file searching during remote debugging. (4019d572ec69fb9631006518166725452c01f675)
- **Enhancement:** Added more test coverage for `devtool ide-sdk` with VSCode, including remote debugging tests on Qemu that verify breakpoints, variables, and source file listing. (413ed3c3ecb3e841ab64ba6881b99a48b034bc68)
- **Enhancement:** Improved the `install_and_deploy` script in `devtool ide-sdk` to accept the target as a command-line argument, enabling IDEs to configure the target dynamically. (4dc41802c97b157c4632b26df567bd1da15e0300)
- **Enhancement:** Enhanced remote debugging configuration to support gdbserver's attach mode as an additional debug configuration in `devtool ide-sdk`. (119171087681bd47842865d6451868c1127f1149)

## Platform Updates

### NXP i.MX
- **New Hardware**: Support added for the mx943-nxp-bsp machine in `imx-mcore-demos`. (f2d705e4372777457e00daefa9fbd139607d46df)
- **EULA Update**: Updated the EULA to v63 for NXP BSP release 6.12.49-2.2.0. (3b31f9d6ba41cbe14f023e553743c8b4fd967900)
- **Recipe Update**: Added imx-mcore-demos version 25.12.00 from meta-imx. (ebaf2a53a2ab2c8b02870c04fe390407c002da16)
- **Maintenance**: Simplified the `imx-system-manager.inc` file. (6d53a64dc177992d8e52318210327a57efc40940)
- **Maintenance**: Added compatibility with the `mx943-generic-bsp` machine for `imx-system-manager` and `imx-oei`. (c250cca81f49868e3448e2cc16535e67a6f594df, 5c6c68595f06a04b418d3b398069c9b1c5e5bec6)
- **Recipe Update**: Bumped the `SRCREV` for `imx-system-manager` and `imx-oei` to the latest version on master. (16ece4a2d90baea1d2cfbe98a8465a969c08014d, e7e2f208f94e1a3a2e7717763075d4178156ea80)
- **Breaking Change**: Adapted U-Boot configuration for i.MX93/943 to deprecated `UBOOT_CONFIG` syntax. (92c2035b56f1264207231ab9d4f3b6104e6a038c, cf66b915d746c8a4965290c60d01da007bc88f15)
- **Build Fix**: Renamed `qemu.inc` to `qemu-qoriq.inc` to avoid filename collision with meta-virtualization. (df4ab9de1cda876742fd7b334211c4c821fa3474)

### Raspberry Pi
- **Antenna Certification**: Raspberry Pi is now certifying third-party antennas for use with Compute Modules, providing a white paper outlining the certifications and testing required for commercial and industrial customers.
- **Recipe update**: `rpidistro-ffmpeg` recipe was upgraded to latest upstream, 7.1.13 version, x264 is disabled due to cyclic dependency. (046a23892770accf32776bd16a2bf6ad534f42eb)

### NVIDIA Jetson
- **Kernel Update**: meta-tegra temporarily re-added recipe for linux-yocto 6.12 after it was dropped from OE-Core master. This is to allow for the NVIDIA OOT drivers to be updated for the 6.18 kernel. (4a88f4dce98b4c49d4c8bc987c0dfa2421b74239)

## Layer Compatibility
- The meta-freescale `qemu.inc` recipe renaming addresses a conflict with meta-virtualization, which can affect builds including both layers.

## Technical Discussions
- The Yocto Project documentation mailing list includes ongoing discussions on improving the BBMASK variable documentation. A series of patches clarify how to use BBMASK to mask files in directories and their subdirectories, including the use of leading slashes and BBFILE_PATTERN for absolute path matching.
- There are multiple patches addressing issues in the switcher menu logic for the documentation.
