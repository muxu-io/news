## Executive Summary

Yocto Project 5.0.15 (scarthgap-5.0.15) has been released, addressing host system failures with `tar` on Alma 9, Rocky 9, and Centos Stream 9.  A discussion is ongoing about moving OP-TEE support from meta-arm to oe-core due to its adoption by non-ARM architectures.  Several recipes in meta-openembedded have been updated for security fixes and new features.

## Critical/Urgent

- **Yocto Project 5.0.15 Release:** This release addresses a bug affecting host systems using Alma 9, Rocky 9, and Centos Stream 9, where `tar` execution fails due to a CVE fix in newer `tar` versions. The Yocto Project release notes describe the issue and identify the root cause.  A fix to update to a newer pseudo version which handles this syscall is planned for a future release. ([https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto-announce/message/368](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto-announce/message/368))

## Yocto Core

- The Yocto Project 5.0.15 release had issues with incorrect tags for `meta-yocto` and `yocto-docs`. These have been corrected, requiring a `git pull --force` on the `yocto-docs` repository to get the correct tags. ([https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66177](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66177), [https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66176](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66176))
- Discussion continues on moving OP-TEE support from `meta-arm` to `oe-core`. The primary concern is whether RISC-V and other architectures will genuinely reuse the same recipes, or if forking will negate the benefits of a shared location.  Vendor BSPs often avoid dependencies on `meta-arm`, preferring to copy recipes. ([https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66178](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66178))
- `bitbake-setup` has been updated to allow descriptions for fragment choices, improving usability during the `bitbake-setup init` process. This feature is backwards compatible with existing configurations. ([https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8637](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8637)) A patch has been submitted to add tests for `oe-fragments-one-of`. ([https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8639](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8639)) Documentation updates are included. ([https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8636](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8636))
- A patch series has been submitted to redefine documentation terms related to the Poky obsolescence, mainly concerning the "Source Directory" and how the setup is handled using `bitbake-setup` or manual cloning. ([https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8641](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8641))

### NXP i.MX
- Several recipes in `meta-freescale` have been updated to add a `HOMEPAGE` variable: `imx-gpu-viv`, `imx-gpu-g2d`, `firmware-imx`, `udev-rules-imx`, and `mesa-etnaviv-env`. ([https://github.com/Freescale/meta-freescale/commit/36f3e4d195752a5d5cbbde462168f876fe2832d9](https://github.com/Freescale/meta-freescale/commit/36f3e4d195752a5d5cbbde462168f876fe2832d9))
- A user reported a warning with `linux-qoriq` recipe in scarthgap regarding OLDEST_KERNEL being "5.15" but the kernel version is "5.10". A possible solution for using a newer 6.6 kernel is proposed using the meta-qoriq layer.

### NVIDIA Jetson
- **Action Required** A user reports inability to download sources from Gerrit for over a week. This can be a build blocker.
- Several posts on the Jetson AGX Orin forums indicate problems with USB after upgrading from JetPack 5.1 to 6.2 and potential fixes for issues with AQR113C network card.

## Layer Compatibility

## Technical Discussions

- Discussion on the Yocto mailing list regarding moving OP-TEE support from `meta-arm` to `oe-core`, specifically focusing on whether RISC-V will use the same recipes. The duplication of recipes in vendor BSP layers is also mentioned. This thread is relevant to layer maintainers who are working with secure boot and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
