## Executive Summary

This week's embedded Linux digest focuses on kernel and security updates, a potential build issue when using newer versions of `tar`, and some important updates to the `meta-arm` layer. A new i.MX943 EVK machine configuration has been added. Several updates and fixes were provided for `meta-openembedded`.

## Critical/Urgent

-   **Security:** Multiple CVE fixes have been backported to older Yocto releases (Kirkstone 4.0.32 and Whinlatter 5.3.1). Engineers maintaining systems based on these releases should review and apply the fixes.

## Yocto Core

-   **Yocto Project 5.3.1 Released:** The Yocto Project 5.3.1 release (whinlatter-5.3.1) is now available, including bug fixes and security updates. See the release notes for details: <https://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-5.3.1/RELEASENOTES>
-   **Build issue with newer tar:** Users of Alma 9, Rocky 9, and Centos Stream 9 may experience build failures with recent host distro updates due to a new `glibc` call/syscall (`openat2`) in newer versions of `tar`. A fix will be included in a future release.

## Platform Updates

### NXP i.MX
-   **New Machine Configuration:** A new machine configuration for the i.MX 943 EVK (`imx943-19x19-lpddr4-evk`) has been added.
-   **Boot Container Support for i.MX95:** i.MX95 based boards using mainline U-Boot will now use binman to build the boot container. This removes the need for the `imx-boot` recipe.

## Layer Compatibility

-   **meta-arm fix for license file checksums:** meta-arm: fixup new override syntax usage - The placing of ' ' in combination with inline python variable expansion can lead to missing/skipping the license file checksum verification. Fix this by using `+=` which itself adds a space instead of `:append` which concatenates strings without inserting a space. This issue affects the `trusted-firmware-a` recipe and was introduced by commit `8dfdacd75c6c`. <https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/meta-arm/message/6893>

## Technical Discussions

-   **RFC: Moving OP-TEE Support from meta-arm to oe-core:** There is a proposal to move the OP-TEE recipes from `meta-arm` to `oe-core`, as OP-TEE is now being adopted by non-ARM platforms. Concerns were raised about forking, with a suggestion to initially focus on `qemuarm64` and `qemuriscv64` using upstream OP-TEE. <https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66212>
-   **Proposal to Remove meta-arm-systemready:** The `meta-arm-systemready` layer is proposed for removal due to failing CI tests, outdated ACS compliance suite support, and the limited value of running compliance tests within a Yocto build. <https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/meta-arm/message/6887>
