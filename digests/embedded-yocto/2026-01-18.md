## Executive Summary

This week's digest highlights several noteworthy developments in the embedded Yocto space. Ongoing efforts to stabilize the Yocto Project's autobuilder are discussed, as they are blocking progress on stable releases.  New versions of several OpenEmbedded packages, including nodejs (with security fixes), have been released.  Finally, there is an end-of-life (EOL) announcement for JetPack 5, prompting users to migrate to newer JetPack versions.

## Critical/Urgent

-   **EOL Notice: JetPack 5** will reach End-of-Life in Q3 2026. NVIDIA will no longer provide updates, but ecosystem partner RidgeRun may offer extended support. Users are encouraged to plan migration to JetPack 6 or 7.2.

## Yocto Core

-   **Yocto Project Autobuilder Issues:** Intermittent failures on the autobuilder cluster continue to block progress on stable releases and merging changes into master. A dedicated team is investigating these failures, and the community is requested to assist in bug squashing.

-   **Yocto 5.0.15.rc3 QA Complete:**  QA for yocto-5.0.15.rc3 has been completed with no high milestone defects or new issues found. ([Yocto Mailing List](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto/message/66141))
-   **oe-git-archive: Ensure new push parameter is specified:** Fixes a regression in "oeqa/gitarchive: Fix git push URL parameter" due to a missing parameter. ([OpenEmbedded Core Commit](https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded-core/commit/983cb2171e53564bc9dd188136439f3e2ad9e188))

## Platform Updates

### Raspberry Pi

-   **Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2:** A new AI HAT featuring the Hailo-10H neural network accelerator (40 TOPS INT4) for generative AI on Raspberry Pi 5. It includes 8GB of dedicated RAM for larger models and maintains privacy, security, and cost-efficiency by processing AI locally.
