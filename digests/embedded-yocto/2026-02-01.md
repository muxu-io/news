## Executive Summary

This week's updates include several recipe upgrades in meta-openembedded, notably `wireshark` which includes a fix for a CVE. `meta-arm` is updating to OP-TEE version 4.9, which will be of interest to those using ARM's reference platforms or the Corstone-1000. The Raspberry Pi Smart Display Module was announced, along with documentation improvements in the Yocto Project.

## Critical/Urgent

- **Security:** The `wireshark` recipe in meta-openembedded has been upgraded to version 4.6.3, which contains a fix for CVE-2025-0962.  This should be prioritized for systems using `wireshark`.

## Yocto Core

- **Documentation:** The bitbake user manual has been updated with improved documentation regarding `bbappend` file matching, clarifying the use of the "``%``" wildcard character and providing further examples. ([PATCH v3](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8853))
- **Documentation:**  Several updates to documentation, such as a fix for the `install-buildtools` path and removal of obsolete poky references. See the pull requests for master ([master](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8847)), whinlatter ([whinlatter](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8846)), and scarthgap ([scarthgap](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/docs/message/8845)).

## Platform Updates

### Raspberry Pi

-   The Raspberry Pi Smart Display Module was announced, designed for high-quality, low-power display experiences for professional signage applications. It integrates with Compute Module 5 and conforms to the Intel® SDM specification.  See the [announcement](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-smart-display-module-coming-soon/).
-   **rpidistro-ffmpeg/rpidistro-vlc Whinlatter Fixes:** `meta-raspberrypi` has commits to fix compilation issues with rpidistro-ffmpeg ([cc665244bc804a773c6603a6dc7d55f3bfb8b05d](https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi/commit/cc665244bc804a773c6603a6dc7d55f3bfb8b05d)) and rpidistro-vlc ([e00b8ea8530b2ff169cb91cf3ce06f06f76ac0d0](https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi/commit/e00b8ea8530b2ff169cb91cf3ce06f06f76ac0d0)) on the Whinlatter release.

### NVIDIA Jetson

- meta-tegra has been updated to upgrade OpenCV to 4.13 ([1fc6140343583e89a6e52038a6b39d6876fbbcb7](https://github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra/commit/1fc6140343583e89a6e52038a6b39d6876fbbcb7)).

## Layer Compatibility

-   The `meta-arm` layer is upgrading to OP-TEE version 4.9.0 and dropping support for version 4.7.0.  This change also updates the `corstone1000` machine configuration to use OP-TEE 4.9.0. This requires review if you maintain or use these components. ([PATCH v3 0/3](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/meta-arm/message/6883))
